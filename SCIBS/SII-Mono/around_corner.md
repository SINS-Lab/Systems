# Procedure for tuning a beam around the Mono

## Pre-Setup

-  Follow procedures for starting a beam in S1
-  Turn off the ion gauge for S2

## Step 1, Tune a beam on F

The FRED box has some BNC cables connected to it, each is labelled at the end, the one labelled "F" is the front entry plate of the Mono, so start by tuning the beam onto this part.
