# Procedure for Pumping Down

* Load sample and completely shut vacuum port door
* First hand tighten ‘Gold-Seal Valve’ and then tighten to 8 ft-lb (96 in-lb) with appropriate torque wrench
* Open the gate valve (below Floating High Voltage Supply rack)
    * Hit red button under plastic guard. Button should be flush with the panel after pushing.
    * Hit small red push button (reset switch) and listen for sound of gate valve opening.
* Turn on the mechanical/backing pump by switching on the power strip.
* Within ~**30 seconds** of turning on the mechanical/backing pump, hit the “start” button on the orange box that controls the TMP
* Within **10 minutes** of the TMP reaching normal operation, turn on the pressure gauge for channel 1.
* Wait for appropriate pressure before starting up ion beam
    * 10-8 Torr → ideal
    * 10-7 Torr → o.k.
    * 10-6 Torr → something wrong!
