# Shutting Down Ion Beam

Note: No time limitations when reducing currents and voltages for shutdown.

* Turn dial for source current (MIT Ion Source) back to zero.
* Turn down “V-Accel” (Floating High Voltage Supply) to zero for safety.
* Turn off switch for Arduino to disconnect the bias batteries.
* Stop here if planning to do more experiments the next day otherwise continue.
* Turn down “VF 1” (Floating High Voltage Supply) to zero.
* Turn down horizontal deflectors (under “El. Field” in Velocity Filter).
* Turn down vertical deflectors (under “Initial” in Beam Deflectors).
* Turn off horizontal deflectors
* Turn off vertical deflectors
* Turn off Floating High Voltage Supply
* Turn off “Filament” switch of the MIT Ion Source (be careful since switch is not seated properly).
* Leave system like this if you plan to do more experiments on the currently loaded sample in the next week or two, otherwise turn off pumps and vent chamber (see relevant instructions).
