# Venting Chamber

Note: Source will be warm after running, so wait at least 2 hours for things to cool down before proceeding with venting!

* Turn off pressure gauge for channel 1
* Hit the “stop” button on the orange box below the beamline to stop driving the TMP.
* Close the gate valve (below Floating High Voltage Supply rack)
    * Hit red button under plastic guard. Button should be popped out. Should hear gate valve close
* Turn off the power strip on the floor next to the large white box to turn off the mechanical/backing pump.
* Open the ‘Gold-Seal Valve’ (near 8 ft-lb label):
    * At first use the appropriate torque wrench
    * Continue to loosen by hand as much as desired
* Open vacuum port door
    * If vacuum port door will not open, then briefly open the green Nupro valve and then close it again (near ‘Gold-Seal Valve’). Try again to open the vacuum port door.
