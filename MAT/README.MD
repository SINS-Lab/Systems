Log of SINS-LAB for MAT Chamber

## 2021-03-12:

#### 13:00

DM & PRJ: screwed on fan to turbo for MAT chamber & turned on MAT chamber. Put temporary filter on mechanical pump since turning on MAT chamber pumps made weird smell. Currently MAT chamber as a Gas ion source, RGA (Residual Gas Analyzer), and a UHV pressure gauge.

#### 13:30

DM: Cleaned filter for MAT chamber with water. Will let filter air dry over the weekend before putting it back together and on the MAT chamber system
